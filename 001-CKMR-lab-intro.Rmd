# Preliminaries {-}

The course will start with 4 sets of slides, take a brief detour into a code demo for study design, and then finish up with a fifth set of slides.The following is the middle piece - the study design "code demo"!

I'll preface this with saying that I just plan on showing Rmarkdown in the workshop, as I'm not sure people really get much by cutting and pasting code snippets into R.  There is also a bit of a toolchain to get this code working.  However, if you're interested in getting the code up and running you should follow the instructions at 

https://eriqande.github.io/tws-ckmr-2022/

I've followed Eric Anderson's lead in using the Renv package to make sure R packages all work together (those used here date back to fall 2022).  But you will also need to have RTools, etc.  Please see Eric's detailed instructions to try to get something working if you're interested in running the code yourself.
